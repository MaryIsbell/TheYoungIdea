[line break]

Thrown together as we are for years, how successful it becomes that we should endeavour to con-join friendship with discipline, and amusement with duty, in order that we may not soon tire of our floating home.=

We must have recourse to some means of passing the wary hour, which lie heavily on our hands;- and what can be more pleasing than to take up our pen, and note down the ideas which ebb & flow with the tide of reason. —

It is the promulgation of these Ideas which we desire to understand, & we hope that we may find our efforts seconded by our shipmates.

We lack amusement;- it is found in the knowledge of others, who, [column break] too reserved to give to forth in pub-lic, may not refuse to see it ap-pear in black & white, springing from an unknown source.

Wit is like a treasure, it [scratch out] may sometimes sparkle on the sur=face, but will more wealthy require labour to bring it forth. <!! This doesn’t make sense but I don’t know what else it would say because TYI is different than the Bampfield !!>

Amongst so many it is next to impossible that good Ideas should be wanting;- and altho’ our mono=tonous and ever changing sea life may not present matters of interest to the feebler imaginations, yet the stranger [insert]will[/insert] seize an in [illegible] [illegible] of the slightest moment, and [cross out] scantily convert them with a combination of information and a-musement, which can never fail to be highly appreciated.—

Our columns often an opening for every description of a moment.
