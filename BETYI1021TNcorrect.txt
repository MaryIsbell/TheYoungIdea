Thrown together as we are for years, how needful it became that we should endeavour to con-join friendship with discipline, and amusement with duty, in order that we may not soon tire of our floating home.=

We must have recourse to some means of passing the many hours which lie heavily on our hands;- and what can be more pleasing than to take up our pen, and note down the ideas which ebb & flow with the tide of reason. —

It is the promulgation of these Ideas which we desire to undertake, & we hope that we may find our efforts seconded by our shipmates.

We lack amusement;- it is found in the knowledge of others, who, [column break] too reserved to give to forth in pub-lic, may not refuse to see it ap-pear in black & white, springing from an unknown source.-

Wit is like a treasure, it [scratch out] may sometime; sparkle on the sur=face, but will mare usually require labour to bring it forth. =

Amongst so many it is next to impossible that good Ideas should be wanting;- and altho’ our mono=tonous and never changing sea-life may not present matters of interest to the feebler imaginations, yet the stranger [insert]will[/insert] seize an event even of the slightest moment, and [cross out] readily convert them with a combination of information and a-musement, which can never fail to be highly appreciated.—

Our columns afford an opening for every description of a moment,

we are ready at all times to receive the efforts of genius, or the flow of wit, and by a pleasant conjunction of both to produce a Journal which shall be attractive sensible and lasting. .
