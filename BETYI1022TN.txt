we are ready at all times to receive the efforts of genius, or the flow of wit, and by a pleasant conjunction of both to produce a journal which shall be attractive sensible and lasting. .

It is not our intention to give a place to articles which are intended to throw any reflection to conduct or habit of others, and we earnestly desire that no such communication; may be forwarded to us, as we shall cosign that within the least com=passion to our waste paper basket; we wish to sit; up a better motive amongst our Reader, for the occupation of their Pen.—

Bearing this then will in mind we invite all to essay their work & we hope to see the “Young Idea”— soon dispel the gloomy clouds [scratchout] which at present overhang its na=tavity. — —	A.D. Mc A.

Dear Sir, I have pirared with much pleasure the first and opening Number of your formal;- with your consider me too obtrusive, if I state my opinion and give advice on the subject. — 	Many like attempts have been made, & have been carried on with success, until some unfortunate affair does arise to promote discord where harmony exists, and enmity is the place of friendship;— against [illegible] wait guard yourself, and a prime hand is required to control the way head-strong articles which you will find from in fast & thick pen flow, as your columns give strength. =	I am one of the last to wish to destroy any hope=ful endeavor, [scratchout] but at the same time I  cannot refrain from giving that ad-vice which is sincere, and warm & which springs from an entirely friendly fell-ing in my part towards your efforts.

I hope each successive Number will pursue the course held out by the first, and if that continues, you may attain an end which will promote [scratchout] Measure & amusement;- as well as instruction, should some of the older and wiser heads support you with their con-tributions.= With heat [crossout] write, Believer

“Chesapeake”

17. Dec: 1857., Yours sincerely, “Spero Meliora”.
