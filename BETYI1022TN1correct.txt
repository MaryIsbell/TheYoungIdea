“The Young Idea.”- HMS “Chesapeake”.- Dec<hi>r</hi> : 19. 1857.-

[line break]

we are ready at all times to receive the efforts of genius, or the flow of wit, and by a pleasant conjunction of both to produce a Journal which shall be attractive sensible and lasting..

It is not our intention to give a place to articles which are intended to throw any reflection; on the conduct or habits of others, and we earnestly desire that no such communication; may be forwarded to us, as we shall cosign them without the least com=puction to our waste paper basket; we wish to set; up a better motive amongst our Reader, for the occupation of their Pen.—

Bearing this then will in mind we invite all to essay their best & we hope to see the “Young Idea”— soon dispel the gloomy clouds [scratchout] which at present overhang its na=tavity. — —	A.D. Mc A.

To the Editor of the “Young Idea.”—
[line break]

Dear Sir, I have perused with much pleasure the first and opening Number of your Journal;- with your consider me too obtrusive, if I state my opinion and give advice on the subject. — 	Many like attempts have been made, & have been carried on with success, until some unfortunate affair has arisen to promote discord where harmony exists, and enmity is the place of friendship;— against their <gap reason=“indecipherable”><quantity=“5” unit=“chars”/> wait guard yourself, and a firm hand is required to control the many head-strong articles which you will find from in fast & thick upon you, as your columns gain strength. =	I am one of the last to wish to destroy any hope=ful endeavour, [scratchout] but at the same time I cannot refrain from giving that ad-vice which is sincere, and warm & which springs from an entirely friendly feel-ing on my part towards your efforts.;

I hope each successive Number will pursue the course held out by the first, and if that continues, you may attain an end which will promote [scratchout] pleasure & amusement;- as well as in-struction, should some of the older and wiser heads support you with their con-tributions.= With best [crossout] wishes, Believer Yours sincerely, “Spero Meliora.”
