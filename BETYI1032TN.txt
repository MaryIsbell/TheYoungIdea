At Chatham first we bade adieu
To Eng with friends, & juried our crews,
Our anchor’s weighed, our sails unfurled,
And we must plough the watery world;
	For we are outward bound, my boys.&c

The wind it Bows from about N<hi>th</hi> East,
Our Ship she sails ten knots at least,
Our roaring guns the foes defy,
And we with sink before we fly;-
	For we, &c &c,
— . -

To foreign Countries we must steer;-
Farewell to wive and shweethearts dear;-
Our Queen she doth our wants supply,
And for our Queen we’ll bravely die;-
	For we, &c. &c

And now we catch The ‘Atlantic gale,
The Trade-wind soon shall fill our sail,
Across the Line we carrie we shape.
Until we see the stormy Cape,
	For we, &c &c

And then for India’s coast we steer,
Calcutta soon out fame shall hear,
And Hooghly’s stream shall float our reel,
And Sepoy’s fly before our steel,
	For we &c &c
- . -

Or if we sail for China’s shore,
We’ll pap Penaug and Singapore,
Caulor shall see our pendant fly,
And we’ll drop our anchors Shanghai,
	For we &c &c
- . -

And then we’ll pass our time may
In foreign ports for many a day,
A-cruising here, a-cruising there,
All sorts of weather, foul, and fair,
	[crossout] Whilst we &c &c

— . —

We’ll work like men, blow high, blow low,
And serve our time, three years or so,
Until our words, we receive,
And to Old England must preach
	And <hi>then</hi> we’re <hi>homeward</hi> bound, &c

— . —

Ah! — them, wherever we may be,
Bombay, Madras, or Trimocolee,
Rayoon, Malaccus, or Hong Kong,
Shall hear us sing a jovial song,
	When we are homeward bound &c
