Now here’s a health to those we love,
May wives & sweethearts faithful favore,
And may they all, in joyful, strain,
Cry, “Welcome back to your home again!”
	When we are homeward bound &c

So when our Christmas Ever came round,
May we sing again our “Homeward bound”,
And join in mirth where’er we roam,
And drink a health to our “Friends at Home”,
	Whlist we are outward-bound, my boys,
		Whilst we are outward-bound.-

A beautiful meteor was observed on Sunday Evening at 10.15 in the N.W. - Its colour was a pale blue, & it lasted for about 2 seconds.—

The Band of the “Chesapeake” performed in Main Street Crescent Last Saturday Eve:, (^and in) being a public night, [crossout] the atten=dance was better than usual. We under-stand that this splendid Band will shortly commence as entirely new series of Dance Music which cannot fail to be highly acceptable, after the old tune they have given (^even) since we left England.

We have noticed with much pleasure the proper which in being made with the scenes for the Theatre. =

Come, ye lads of the Ocean, attention now pay;-
To unravel my meaning I bid your pay;-
I’m a word of 10 letters, in History famed
For a battle of which we may ne’er be ashamed;-
For its colours, I once bore were soon laid supine
To those which now float from my 6,3,8,9;-
And naught can them lower, or bring to disgrace.
While on the salt seas out ships their path trace.=

In the antics of 8,6,3, fun is found,
The mischief as well in the beast [crossout] does abound;=

When the butcher has come with his sharp ready knife,
And deprived all 4,2,3,7,6, of their life,
Salt grub then cach day on our table we view,
Disguised in all manners, as 2,5,4,2,
Or a stew, or same equally futile attempt
Our tastes, to deceiver, or our palate to tempt:-
But than if 1,2,3,4,10 should come
In the 4,2,5,6,10 of supper, a hum
Of joy an delight soon pervades the small place,
Called the Midshipman’s Berth, our dark dwelling-place;-
Each refer soon empties his plate with good grace,
And there sees my whole staring him in the face

“The dark haired maid of Spain, with native grace, wields her light <hi>fan</hi>, to shield her blushing face;- And thou, dear Chesapeake, when breezes fail; Shalt ply the ponderous fan, that wriggle in the tail”.
