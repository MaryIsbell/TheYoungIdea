— . News from India.

The News we have to communicate the week is necessarily of a somewhat vague character, being derived chiefly from verbal information.=

First of all, we have to lament over the death go General Havelock, who, three days after being relieved at Luckow, fell a victim of dysentery, and, doubtless to the fatigue of body and anxiety of wind which he had recently gone through.

The “Shannon” herself has been lying at Calcutta, in charge of the Madrer.:

On the whole, the rear we have re-ceived as to believe that Some-thing yet remains to be done by the “Ches-apeake” and her crew;- we would [illegible] that a friendly rivalry sh<hi>d</hi> exist between “Chesapeake” & “Shannon”, (waves once so hostile) and hearing what has been [crossout] doing by our Sister Ship, let us hope, and only (to quote words which we published last week) that the “Hooghly way may float our keel”, but who also that “Sepoy”
