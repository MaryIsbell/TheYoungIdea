Answers to Charade of Last week.-

When shall Boston forget the loud soar of our Cannon, 
As “Chesapeake” lowered her Stars to the “Shannon”;-
Now to humble the strong, & to guard o’er the weak,
See the British Bad Corp promptly float from her “peak”;
And “Chesapeake” all, as we sail the salt sea,
With a true British Crew, who so merry as we?=
While fresh Beef or Mutton come, off from the shore,
With carrots or pumpkins, what can we want more.? [column break]
And you, Midship-heroes, when dinner is done,
What “ape” is so full of his antics and fun;-
(Tho’ to do you strict justice, of mischief there’s done.)
But when the last “sheep” has fallen under the knife,
Then salt beef & biscuit must keep up your life,
Or the big “dough” & curranuts (delectable trash)
On Sunday must vary your “lobsKaus” and “lard”;-
Or perchance to make perfect your salt pork & pease,
A supper shall greet you in “shape” or a “cheese”:-
Then cheer up, my hearties, no need to look blank,
While a draught of fresh water remains in the Tank;
Clear your plates:- soon your eyes will on “Chesapeake” rest;-
Where her scroll in encircling the Conquerer’s Crest.-
