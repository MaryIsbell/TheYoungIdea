In memory of W” Hall, A.B, aged 31 y[sup]rs[/sup], and 9 months, who died from the affect of a blow, by the falling of a block from aloft, Saturday, 2[sup]nd[/sup] Jan<hi>y</hi> 1858:- being the first our Ship’s Company, when it has pleased Almighty God to call from among us. — 	J.W.L. B.

Sudden and sad was the factual blow;-
And who Death’s strike was heeding?-
One moment a strong man stood below,
And the next a Corpse lay [fell above in pencil] bleeding:-

We breathed the soft prayer by his cot,
As he lay convuls’d and groaning:-
We called his name, he heeded not,
Or answered but with moaning.-

Then softer, softer came his breath,
Fainted his life is throbbing;-
He coldly stares at coming Death
Us of out Com. rade robbing.-

Then wind him in his hammock shroud,
And fold the Red Cross o’er him,
Let the funeral anthem float aloud,
As we to the deep welcome him.-

Launch, launch his form to the Indian surge,
Let friendly bellows leave him;-
And Ceylon’s hills wait out his drige,
and coral depths encave him.=

And oh! when the Sea shall yield her dead
And his Ocean tomb be given,
May the Judge who once for sinners bled
Vail him in robes of Heaven.=

A Tiffin at Tricomalee.-

[line break]

On Thursday we received a very hospitable invitation from W. Cooper, the Storekeeper of the Dockgrid, to attend a Tiffin at his house in Tricomalee, to celebrate the first anniversary of his little daughter’s birth.; Commodore Watson C.B. attended by 4 or 5 Officers, left the Ship at 1/2 past 1, in his galley, & MM. Faustine with hi, Band & followed in the Cutter.;

A “Tiffin” being something new to English Readers, we will endeavour to give some account of what we saw & did.

We found W. Cooper’s home to be far from the largest & finest looking in Tricomalee
