[line break]

square built & surrounded on all sides with a broad Verandah, supported by strong columns, on the upper as well as the lower story.=	We entered by the lower hall, & proceeding up a broad flight of stairs, found ourselves, in the chief apart-ments of of the house.= The view from the up-per columade was really very pretty, over-looking the Sea, where the waves came willing on to the shore. With considerable surf;- the Fort & Flagstaff perched on a rocky enuience, being the principal object in the landscape.=	When the com-pany were assembled, the gentlemen’s nearly all in white jackets, (which certain-ly seem, the most desirable costume for this place) and the ladies in various colour according to their tastes, the ac-tual “Tiffin”, the great work of the day, commenced.= It consisted of a handsome repast, which to there who had so long known the sight of salt Junk & pease fun-ding was indeed delicious:= we will to confess to the amount of sweets which we stowed beneath our jackets, tho’ indeed [column break] it was with much difficulty we could secure the service of one of the native attendants, who, it appears, are accus-tomed to work solely on their own masters or misstress. =		The “Chesapeake” band, which had marched up in mili-tary order, surrounded by admiring crowd of half-naked Cingalese, now played a succession of Airs in the upper Verandah, & was much admired.. Commodore Watson then purposed the health of the young heroine of the feast, and it was given with three times three.

Dancing then commenced, & many were soon engaged in the entertaining Waltz, or the more sober quadrille, tho’, to tell the truth, we saw some, less oethe-ial, contenting themselves in.- a cigar or pipe in the lower colomnade.

Thus, the afternoon passed quickly away. When the shade of evening fell, the dancing ceased, the company dis-persed;- & we, among the rest, thank-ed out kind host & hostess for their pleasant entertainment.=
