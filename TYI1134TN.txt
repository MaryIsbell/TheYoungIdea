tongue of criticism is prepared to weaken or destroy its affect. We certainly expected that our Amutreurs would not come off scathe less, but we were totally unprepared for such an egre=guious attack as has been made upon them in the Bengal Hurtaru. It was with mingled feelings of astonishment, anger, and amusement we perused the inconsiderate critique upon their endeavors. The whole when carefully weighed forms a “tout ensemble” of the most ridiculous character, and we therefore advise all those who read it to take it in that light, basing their opinions, not merely upon a sentence extracted here there but upon the general sentiment it contains. It opens with a personal cut at W. Van Gelder, thereby evincing that a wish to bring him before the public as a laughing stock, was a prominent feature in the desire to ridicule, which animated the narrow mind, which presumed to judge of our Amateurs performance. The writer then proceeds to state that “he trembled for the fate of those of Neptune’s “hardy sons”,- for why? because “the beauty & fashion of Calcutta was present”, most likely he imagined the “hardy sons of Neptune” could never stand a battery of bright eyes, however brave when con=trolling a battery of heavy guns. But we cannot afford space to pull him [illegible] in the man=ner he deserves, but we must notice one thing- the word “Ditchers” such is the very euphonious appellation which the Histrionic Critic of the “Hukaru” claims for himself and his cossers of Calcutta. We will not now enquire into the origin of the name, but simply observe that such being the title of our assailant-, we need not feel sur-prized to find him such an adept in the art of “flinging mud”. We close this article by publishing the Prologue which was read & written expressly for the occasion.

PROLOGUE

Friends, Patrons, of the “Thespian” aryl I stand,
As spokesman for our little stage struck band:
I come kind pretends respectfully to pray
Indulgent smiles for this out little play.
Think not that we aspire to win a “Name”
In the night path of Histronic fame:
Or that misled by fierce dramatic rage,
we hope “like” “Kear” to strut upon the “stage”
No ’tis the aim of our most humble Muse
To please our patrons and ourselves amuse,
Just this, no more, as Amateurs we come
Let this amoral strike the critics dumb.
No light seen, if our humble skill awaits
we represent a legend of “Marseilles”.
Bambastes next with love and fame elate,
Shall claim your laughter and your mirth creat;
Mingle and follow in out motley train;
Thus a the “Clerk’s” sad Prize, droops pity’s eye,
“Yet” “Simon’s” suppers punds of mirth supply.
With horror “Darnauds vices now regard,
And yield to “Adolpho’s” love its due reward.
Then comes “Bomdashes” may he please you all
And may you laugh until the curtain fall.
Well, then, my friends scare not our sailor’s muse
So shall our tread each moment firmer grow.
Encourage this our unfledged rings first flight,
We’ll strive and please you more another night,
With grateful pride I cast around my gaze
And see a host of English beauty blaze,
soft beaming eyes, sweet lips, in smiles arrayed
Which might have, well, Herculean toils repaid. [column break]
Their praise we covet, may we win the need
Our labor’s light the guerdon great indeed.
But hark! (Bell rings) our little troop impatient rage,
Anxious to Stript their “hour” upon the stage,
And now my friends, with, Avon’s Bard, I pray,
Gently you’ll judge, kindly you’ll hear our play.

H. Montagu was the compose of their really creditable piece. We are glad to say that the other Calcutta Journals, gave a very good account of the performance.
