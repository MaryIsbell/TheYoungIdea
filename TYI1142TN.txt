When they reached the station they were ordered to occupy, the two companies were told off for their respective battachs, which were built-in two parallel rows, each row capable of containing 100 men, and each company was or=dered to occupy one. At the or=der “To your lines, march.” Both companies made a simultaneous rush, at one of these barracks, and began fighting for its occupancy; the bone of contention being its supposed superiority to the other. The Young Officer called his subordinate the native, & directed him to the men, & march them to their proper quar=ters, he replied in an insolent manner “He couldn’t help it, he wasn’t going to trouble himself about it”: The Englishman im=mediately ordered him into ar=rest, and going amongst the combatants, called two of the principal by name, and ordered them to desist, & go to the other barrack; they refused to obey him, and were also put under arrest. These men were all brought to a court martial, which resulted, in the Native Officer. being severely reprimanded, and the goodmen being adjusted [column break] six months imprisonment with hard labour. Immediately on entering the goal they called for writing materials, and ad=dressed an appeal to the commander in Chief, (if we recollect rightly) the consequence of which was they were released from confinement the next day, & marched back to their regi=ment: and as out informant expressed himself, “What must have been the effect of such a transaction upon the regiment, as a body? They were the first to mutiny. We also were in=formed of many similar cases of disaffection, where officers who had shown a spirit wor=thy of a better fate, had met with silent, but not the less evident marks of disapproba=tion for conduct which upheld discipline, and in some cases saved serious outbreaks.

Can we wonder at the mutiny, when we are made aware of facts like these?.
