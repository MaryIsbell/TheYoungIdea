His feet were crossed and lashed together with a port lanyard, and his Knife lanyard was put round his neck and made fast to a worm. The body was quite cold when dis=covered, and life had evidently been extinct for some hours; no signs of struggles were noticed, his counte=nance was not distorted, but there was a little froth about the mouth & other appearances peculiar to strangulation; his hands were laying in his lap. The unhappy man had always been one of the dirtiest men in the ship, and on that account was always in trouble. An investigation was held in the fore cabin with a view to endeavor to discover the reason of the cash act, but without effect. The body was committed to the deep at seven bells the same morning.

<subheader> To the Editor of the Young Idea”</subheader>

Sir

Our friends are Calcutta seem to have had no slight panic in the city on the day following our departure, some mention of which may perhaps fill a nook in the pages of the Chesa=peake Chronicle. On Tuesday Evening (March 2) the report flew thro’ Calcutta that the Barrackpore Sepoys, were in full march upon the town, that they were to find arms at the house of a certain Nawab, on the road, that the jail prisoners were to be set loose the mob of Calcutta to rise, and join them, the Christian in=habitants slaughtered, and their houses given to pillage. Tho’ night time, writes one of the papers, all Calcutta was on the alert; out and to be armed, was the or=der of the night; the Police Marine Bri=gade was marched down to the Maharatta Ditch, and posted so as to defend the bridge towards the Barrackpore road, The guns which are generally tobo [column break] seen at the Police Compound, were ordered out, & so placed as to command the whole of the Bow Bazaar & the Chitpore Poad: the Volunteer Guards were also called out both Artillery and Infantry, & every pro=paration made for the defence of Calcutta. We understand also that information was sent to Cap<hi>t</hi> De Courcy & preparations made for landing the blue jackers from the “Pylades” as well as collecting volunteers from the Merchant Deamer.

The alarm proved to have very slight foundation, the Nawabs arms turned out to be two rusty muskets; but it may ay least show us that a ship of war lying in the Hooghly is not quite uselessly employed, and that Sepoys, (such as your friend “Blue jacket” wishes to encounter) may possibly be met with at Calcutta as well as at Sucknow.

I am Sir,

Your obedient Servant

Perhaps some few comments upon the town of Madras, may not prove uninteresting town readers. We left the ship at 2 P.M. in a mussulah boat with a party of mine others all as desirous as ourselves of visiting the place, and seeing what there was to be seen. The boat we were in first elicited our interest, it was very light & high out of water, and rode buoyantly over every wave, pulled by ten to twelve rowers who kept up a never ending song, which we were informed was to their god to pressure them.	There was very little surf on the beach when we landed but yet some water was shipped to the tempo=rary discomfiture of two of the party. The distance from the boat to the shore was performed on the backs of natives, who surrounded us with most impor=tante solicitations to take palanquins, garries &c. We walked up to the clarendon Hotel, and there saw for the first time the performance of an Indian Gy=gler who certainty astonished us with his tricks which were various, the last, in which, he converted a snakeskin into a living cobra; which he put round his neck & kissed, horrified as much as it amazed us. We found the bazaar much broader & cleaner than those of Calcutta, and no=ticed several Hindoo temples, with the quaint and curious combinations of figure, faces, animals, serdes &c, with which their pointed roofs were decorated The natives are marked deeper & plainer on the forehead than those we saw at Calcutta. but we were informed that the greater number of natives of Madras are Christians, & some Mussulmen. We walked out to New Town, passing on our war a Hindoo burials ground, where we saw a body being consumed by fire according to the customs of the country.
