Our visit being as cursory we were unable to take much note of the place, but we certain=ly considered it far superior to Calcutta, it is beautifully clean & neat, the streets broad & the roads good. Embarking ro return to our ship we found much more pleasant than going on shore. The boats head was turned seaward, & as each surf came rolling in, the united efforts of the crew were made to assist her in coming off with the retreating wave. We hope that Madras will be again visited by the “Chesapeake”.

Those who have the opportunity of Consulting a good Map of India will see the River Gogra, separating the Kingdom of Oude from the more Eastern Provinces. This river base lately been the scene of operation for our gallant comrades of the “Pearl” under Capt<hi>n</hi> Dorhety. By their exertions, working day & night, abridge of boats was thrown across The river from the Eastern to the Western bank, and com=pleted by the 23<hi>rd</hi> Feb<hi>y</hi> when our ally sung Behadoor with his army of Ghoorkas was enabled to march over, and thus make the first entry from this quarter into the oude territory. It was no slight disappointment to our bluejackets that after having thus opened the way to Luck-now, they found themselves ordered back to a spot called Captaingunger, a few miles from the Eastern branch of the Gogra, where probably they will have to remain as a guard to the surrounding country, instead of participating in the assault on the capital It will be seen from this that the statement made in a former paper, of the Pearl’s brigade having been at [symbol] 93abad, which is the wad to Lucknow, was so had incorrect.

A farewell speech from the Gunroom.
