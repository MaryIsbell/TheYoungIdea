Royal marriages certainly are generally not to be envied, and we may rejoice for ourselves that we have liberty to select from any station, or from any coun=try which we may visit, the fair mate who shall hereafter grace and cheer our domi=cile; but in this instance, let us hope that love has been co-existent which the interest of nations, and that the young couple who have now entered upon wedded life, may be as happy hereafter when occupy=ing the throne of Russia, as late=ly they have been, in the first days after love, amidst the secluded retirement of Windsor.

“Farewell Young Princess, mat thy wedded heart;
“Throbbing with youthful love, ne’er learn a pang,
“To make thee mourn the day when joybells rang
And thou from Albions fostering shores didst part

An Intruder.
To the Editor of the Young Idea.

Sir.

We the undersigned members of the feline community now re=sident on board Her majesty’s Ship “Chesapeake” bed respect=fully to remonstrate against the introduction amongst [column break] us of strange animals from the shore.

We have learnt with much concern that a strange Cat of white unnatural aspect, of small head and teeth, and of very enormous tail, (which tail was carried in a very unbecoming position), has recently been encouraged by the Ward Room Officers, and treated with indulgence which has never been extended to ourselves.

We beg therefore to represent that being born of true British Mousers, we have no wish to re=ceive aid from creatures of Asiat=ic origin, and having been duly appointed you our respective po=sitions of “Cat” and “Assistant Cats” on leaving Chatham, we most respectfully decline to accept the services of supernu=meraries.

We have the honor to be, Sir
	Your most obedient Servants

P.S. (Private) The cold tongues de [it’s that symbol that you can never get] which are left for me in the Ward Room at night time, are very nice, but I sometimes prefer fish

Ed. Y. S. We are afraid out correspondents have mixed very little in this transitory and changing world, or they would have Known friends are forgotten, and cast aside; but now, we can only console them by informing them of this painful fact, and trust that their feelings may not overpower animals of which a <hi>feline</hi> nature, and to assure them that they may ever consider the “Young Idea” a friend, and as such ever ready to our best to heal wounds, cement our friendship, dispel discord, and promote a healthy tone, and we therefore recommend their meeting the stranger with warmth and amity.
