The past week has seen us diligently employed upon tho wreck of the Ava “ and fortysix boxes of spice have rewarded our exertions; diving and exploring, have been the prin=ciple features of the work.

There has not been so much done, as we had hoped, but we may attribute this part=ly to unavoidable circumstan=ces: upon the state of the sea rests in a great measure the amount of work done, for the diver cannot get amongst the wreck, when the sea is at all heavy. A new diving dress was brought by the “Ma=illa” from Madras, and it is extremely painful to us to state that upon the first oc=casion of using this, it proved [column break] fatal to one of our best men. This has been a great dra=back to the pleasure in raising the treasure; everyone must regret that in the pursuit of such comparatively worth=less stuff, a life should have been lost; a life, the value of which none can tell.

The arrival of H.M.Ship “Inflexible” from China with despatches and supernu=meraries, has given us an opportunity of learning some=thing accurate concerning events in that quarter.

By the “Benlinck” Mail Packer, we despatched the Alma’s, shaft & the Anchor’s &c from the wreck- receiving in our tush, welcome letter & news from home.
