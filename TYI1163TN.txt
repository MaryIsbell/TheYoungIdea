On the whole, tho’ we have no wish to be shipwrecked mari=ners, yet should such be our lot, we hope we may be no worse off than are the Officers of the “Ava”

Diving Operations
at the Wreck of the “Ava”

Monday. 22<hi>nd</hi> Mar.	On arriving at the wreck this morning, it was found that the sea was so heavy, as to entire-ly preclude the possibility of diving the forepart of the ship was working very much, and the party, were or=dered to return on board again.

Tuesday. 23<hi>rd</hi> Mar: This morning we found that the wreck had been altered in the her position by the violence of the sea, having fallen considerably over on the starboard side, and having sunk deeper by the head. Our diver was however able to go to work, and after some time & labour, a coil of rope was hauled up this with three boxes of money was all that could be got up today. The diver had a narrow es=cape while below, a large beam falling on his foot.

Wednesday. 24<hi>th</hi> Mar: On the diver descending this morning, it was found that the wreck had fallen in on top of the money, and that it would there fore be necessary to blow it up. The necessary arrangements were accord=ingly made, and about 11 the charge was placed and every boar out of dan=ger; the charge being prepared for explosion by galvanism: the batteries being the cutler. after the word “Fire had been given every eye was anxiously bent upon the spot to be blown up, but minutes flew & the time sped, but no explosion. At last the diver was again called into requisition, and the powder case brought up when it was found that swing to the leah, the powder was spoilt & wet. By about 3 PM. a new charge was prepared of 15 lbs, and Bickfords’ Fuze being used, the explosion took place in 7 1/2 min: from the time of its being lighted.

Thursday. 25<hi>th</hi> Mar: Yesterday’s [column break] explosion, had entirely succeeded, and after clearing away two iron beams, our diver was enabled to set to work and raised 16 boxes of treasure, besides some other articles. The new diving dress was tried by two or three volunteer divers, and we deeply regret that one of them TnºWithers, Captain of The Afterguard, met with his death whilst diving. It appears that the unfortunate man descended from the Cutter to sling a box of indigo, the hailing line being placed in the pin nave, in order that the box might be brought up to her side, to be taken in board, he made the signal to haul up which was accordingly done, when he came up by the rope, but no box- the right hand strap was unhooked by one of the pinnace’s crew, who inten=ded to remove the helmet to give him air, but he made the signal to be lowered again, which was accordingly done, the strap being hooked as he was lowered. After reaching the bottom it was noticed he remained in the same position, not walking about at all, this was attributed by many to his being engaged in slinging the box, till at last, suspicions being roused, signals were made to him, and not being an=swered, he was hauled up, and found to be dead, His helmet and iron belt were off, but he was prevented from rising to the surface by heavy leaden weights which were placed in his boots Every effort was made to restore consciousness, but all of no avail, and he was accord=ingly despatched on board, (the dingy having been preciously ordered to get the doctors prepared.

Friday. 26 Mar 1858. This day ten boxes of specie were raised

Saturday. 27<hi>th</hi> Mar. Seventeen boxes were got up today; being the best day’s work we have yet had. The fore part of the vessel was blown up. At first Galvanism was tried, but was again un=successful. and Bickford’s fuze was restored to, and in 6 min 45 sec after the light was applied the explosion took place, throwing a column of water high up in the air, and pieces of plank boxes &c. floated out from the debris. Not having occasional so much damage
