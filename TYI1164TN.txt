Our First Funeral on The Shore

It has already been out lot to commit the bodies of two of our comrades to the deep: yesterday for the first time since the Ship has been in com=mission, we were called to follow the corpse of another to his grave on the sea shore. Poor Withers, who has lost his life in endeavour to recover more treasure by means of the new diving dress was yesterday buried within sight of the scene of the accident. When his body was brought on board on Thursday Ev<hi>g</hi> every endeavour was made, which medical skill could suggest, or friendship devise to restore animation to his form, & his look was so lifelike and placid that his mess mates for two hours could scarily believe him to be dead but all effort was unavailing, to screen was drawn round him the union jack drawn over his body, and the lay for the night more like one in sleep than in death.

At 10A.M. the following morning all was ready for our sad duties. The Ships Bell was slowly bolted as the coffin, covered by the Union Jack was brought up the Main Hatchway and silently lowered into a boat alongside While Officers & crew stood on the Deck Bareheaded. The Ensidn was lowered half-mast, and those also of the “Inflexible”, & “Dentinck” which lay near us. And now the procession of Boats moves onwards to the Shore; that which bore the corpse, followed by his other cutters, then the galley containing Officers and lastly the Commodore himself, with the Commander & chaplain in the Barge, their Ensigns also are half mast high and trailing to the water’s edge. Passing the wreck & diving eft, the scene of the disaster they soon touch the shallow sandy beach, opposite the tents of the Ava’s crew. The funeral procession is then formed on shore, the Band of the “Chesapeake” leading the way, & playing a slow & dirge like march, then the coffin borne by the messmates of the dead, & followed by the Boats Crews & Officers as mourners. The spot chosen for interment is some little distance along the beach, to the right of the encampment, it is in the deep sand, just at the border of the jungle: as we near the spot, the chaplain advances from the grave, the notes of the band are hushed, & the opening words of the Fune=ral service are heard in their place. And now we impressive words “earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust” meet our ears, and the casting of the sand upon service is over; our procession is performed, and to maimed behind to witness the filling in the grave as hard as the loose nature of the sand permits, a at the head of the grave and another at the foot.we speak of the deceased. “Withers was a worthy Seamand, a valued Petty Officer, and a good mess mate” He leaves a widowed mother to mourn his loss, he supported her; shall she be forgotten?

Captain Sotheby’s brigade has been attacked by 12.000 of the rebels, whom they routed with dreadful slaughter & captured eight guns, on our side, one officer (a Decon master) and one Seaman were killed, and twenty wounded

Commissioner Yeh has been safely de=posited in Fort William. Things in China pretty quiet & the Admiral about to go horth=ward.

FACETIAE.

A Pound put out to good Interest. Pound the diver of the Chesapeake has now succeeded in bringing up about (currency symbol)40.000 from the wreck of the Ava, and this in the space of a few days, we have certainly never heard of a single Pound being so profitably invested before.

That incorrigible Small wit. Small wit seeing all the boxes of treasure that have been coming up day after day was heard to remark that whatever Peel’s brigade way be doing, it is the “Chesapeake’s who have got <hi>Luck-now</hi>
