Vane (Vein) of Copper might anyway be seen at the Masthead. Out investigation being so far satisfac=tory, we now turned out attention to the more precious metals; with the view of ascertaining the existence of gold, we begged to be shown & specimens of whatever sand might be on board, and a buck of sand having been brought from the foretold, we washed & searched it carefully, but without discovering any traces of the precious metal. We then enquired whether any Quarts existed in the Ship, and were answered that plenty of Quarts could be seen in the Ward-Room Wine Stores, but here also, we regret to say our search for gold proved equally unsuccessful. On our enquiring next, whether any precious Metal might be found among the Ship’s Company, we re=ceived answer that British sailors are always distinguished for <hi>Mettle</hi> of the highest quality. This caused us to turn our attention to the Lower Deck, but neither silver or gold rewarded out in=vestigation. We have much pleasure however in stating that on examining the White Hats usually loom by Seamen, we were enabled to discover a very considerable quantity of plait-en-‘em (platinum)

Diving Operations at the Wreck of the “Ava”.

Monday 29<hi>th</hi> Today our diver succeeded in raising 10 Boxes of treasure. On coming off in the evening some little fan was occasioned by the attempts made to catch a Rock Cod which was floating on the surface of the water, and which af=ter eluding the slippery grasp of a marine, and being twice hit on the head with the blade of an oar, finally made off with an impudent wag of his tail ^& disappeared under water much to the chagrin and disappointed of the Boat’s Crew.

Tuesday. 30<hi>th</hi> 13 Boxes of treasure rewarded the exertions of our diver today.

Wednesday 31<hi>st</hi> 14 Boxes of treasure were raised today and also a box containing Precious stones.

Thursday 1<hi>st</hi> April. A.M. An attempt was made to blow up the deck under the stage, but the fuze being old and rotten did not explode the charge. Two shells were then let down with double fuzes but neither of them exploded. A breaker containing 45lbs of Powder was then let down into the skylight on the after part of the wreck, this was fitted with about 3ft of fuze and lighted & let go in 1 1/2 min it exploded sending a column of water 20 ft high, & entirely destroying the wreck at that part. In the Afternoon two other ex=plosions were effected in the after part of the wreck, with satis factory results. Two large Rock cod were killed by these explosions.

Saturday. 3<hi>rd</hi> Today the diver descended into the after part of the Vessel to seek for the Bullion Room, after some trouble & time he succeeded in his search and brought up four boxes of treasure besides various other part of the vessel after the diving was over, but it was unsuccessful, the fuze not being good.

Facetiae

“Jack and Gill”- a New Version of an old Nursery Rhyme

“Jack most dearly loves his Gill,
“And little cares for water,
“And Jack will work with all his will,
“If his Gill is coming after.”

“Well.! I call that a dead wether “weather” as the Ship’s Butcher said when he had killed a sheep.

Sum’em, Bone’em! (“Summum Bonem”) as the Merchant’s Clerk laid when he, first counted his master’s rupees, and then walked off with them.

A Correspondent from the wreck writes the contents of the Ava’s holds are rapidly diminishing, and we hope that M<hi>r</hi>Broome will soon make a clean sweep of it..

A Contributor sends us the following Con. Why is a sulking seaman like a voracious fish? —Because he’s a horrid shirk. (shark)

We commit this to our pages that the public may decided what punishment shall be inflicted upon the unhappy man who inverted it.

Riddles &c.

<!-- this should be tagged as a table technically since these riddles are side by side but for transcription sake I’m going to do L1, R1, L2, R2, L3, R3 -->

Poor broken shatter’d wreck. 
With all thy silver sunken hoard

Beneath the waves immersed
Thou, thou shalt be my FIRST

To all that swarthy crerr
My SECOND with its smooth white grain

On these wild shores that live
Aplentous meal will give

Then ne’er may thirst of wealth
But while the treasured prize we raise

Reign tyrant in our oul
Ood keep us from my WHOLE

32. Why is it the Queen, finding fault with her Ambassadors like those who destroyed the gates of Delhi?

33. What is the difference between a story related by a wit and the mark of pleasure exhibited by a dog?
