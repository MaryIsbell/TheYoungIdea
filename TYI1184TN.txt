Our Navel Brigades.

The Shannon’s Brigade is showing we believe in the Ward fighting at Lucknow and in the attendant glory Lucknow report says, is now entirely in the hands of the British army, but the Mutineers have retired in strong force, and have taken up fresh positions of defense at Bareilly & Rohilcund.		The “Pelorus” brigade we be=live that a private letter has been recently received, and that they are occupying a Fort about 300 miles up the Irrawaddy River, on the northern frontier of Pegu; with the view of intercepting any hostile demonsta-tion from the Ava. Territory

We may take this opportunity of stalling that if any of our ship maters are in receipt of letters from the various parts of the station, we should esteem it a favor, if they would send us extracts, such as convert public intelligence for the benefit of our columns. News from the Brigades will be especially interesting: when shall we have to record the advances of our own (Chesapeake’s’) Brig=ade?

An extraordinary (S)cuttle-fish

We beg to remind those who are in the habit of sleeping in their Cabins with scuttles open, that the waters of these seas are said to abound with sea snakes of most dangerous, as well as most adventurous disposition. They will not only climb up cables and hawsers, and so effect an entrance into the ship; but are said at times even to scale the ship’s side, and take a peep at the interior thro’ the scuttles on ports which they may find open. We have not yet been surprised by any of these nocturnal visi=tors, and we have no desire to be so, and we all be our timely warning of this most unwelcome and disagreeable species of (s)cuttle fish.

Diving Operations at the Wreck of the “Ava”

On Sunday last the Native divers got up twenty boxes of treasure.

<hi>Monday 5<hi>th</hi></hi> Our diver raised thirty seven boxes and the Natives one

Tuesday 6<hi>th</hi> Today our divers raised [column break] sixteen boxes, and the Natives seven, they also raised one of the casks of money, which was broken, and several of the rupees are lost. A grand explosion took place after the diving was over, 200 lbs of powder being put in a large oil cask, which was extended to have been sank under the weather side of the wreck Owing the some unexplained cause, when the fuzes were lit, the cask did not sink as expected, and the explosion had no effect on the vessel

The next morning a more success=ful attempt was made, and the wreck has since, entirely disappeared under water. 

By accounts from our diving party we learn that about thirty four boxes gave been obtained - all well.

Boils have been very prevalent lately in consequence of which we are sorry to say that some of the younger members of our community have exhibited a most unusual amount of cheek.

Why are Mess<hi>rs</hi> Broadwood & C<hi>o</hi> like the Peminsu=lar & Oriental steam Company? Because they are a P&O (piano) company. We recommend the inventor of this conundrum to try again.
