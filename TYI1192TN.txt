sitioin. May Lord Derby now prove to be “the light man in the light place,” & at least maintain the honour of Eng=land intact & unimpeachable in the eyes of all nations. But we forget that we are sitting in our easy chair in the Trincomalee Newsroom; we have glanced over the Naval Columns, & see Sir John Pakington walking into the Admitralty, and Sir Cha<hi>l</hi> Wood walking out; we hope that Sir J. Pakington & his retinue may be of some service in lifting the “bold “Chesapeake”s up the ladder of promotion. we have looked at the pictures of the Illustrated News “& find that China’s India, still occupy the pencils of their Artists. We have vouchs afed a glance also the Colonial “Colombo” Paper, & gathered the scraps of Cingalese intelli=gence, which however, as yet, do not excessively interest us. Other readers are coming in, Native young men, or intelligent half castes, (the true subscribers to the Sibrary), are wishing to gather the in=formation at hand; as well as ourselves, so we vacate our seat, like Lord Pal=merston, and with our politest bow to our dark hued neighbours, & best thanks for the privilege of their lead=ing room we retire again to the public [column break] road, forget Lord Palmenston, & all the affairs of state, & watch the blue sea waves curling in to the shore, and inhale the fresh breezes that come sweep-ing in from the Indian Ocean.

Alas! theta we should have to record, that these delicate slices of English Mutton, which were so praised by the residents of Trincomalee, came from the joints of our old ship’s favorite “Poor luck”!! But we must dry our Editorial tears and again look down upon the brilliant moving spectacle, about two hours later when the Waltz and Quadrille succeed-ed to Opera Strains, and human fingers flitted thro’ the apartments in various labyrinthine gyrations. Most of us are now sufficiently acquainted with the commodore’s hours, to thank, that it presents a specimen of marvel rather than
