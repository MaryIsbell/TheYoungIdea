the glade, about four hundred yards ahead, & disap=pearing in a thicket. Between us & him there was a brook thro’ which we had to wade kneedeep, and had we known how often we were doomed <hi>to cross a ford</hi>, or wade thro’ a spring in our peregrinations, we should have removed our boots, which could ill <hi>afford to cross</hi> such places & we would willingly have taken <hi>a spring across,</hi> had there been less width, but could <hi>brook</hi> no delay, so gallantly followed our less encumbered guide.

Our bird had disappeared when we ar=rived at the place where we had seen him, so we continued our march. Again, out breasts were excited, with hopes of success, on seeing another splendid bird, slowly & proudly strutting along a path some distance ahead. He speedily saw us, and deeming, we suppose, that a nearer acquain=tance would not prove beneficial to him, he dis-appeared at a graceful trot among the bushes, which fired his path on either side.

Our guide now led us across a piece of running water, over which a bridge was thrown, & the passage consequently <hi<abridged</hi>, and out poor boots were spared another soaking. We now observed a peacock feeding. To arrive near him it was requisite to crawl along hands and knee so, accordingly down we went, and after progressing in this mestis factory man=ner for about 40 yards, observed out bird to rise majes=tically on the wing & leave us in a disgusted spectator & sole monarch of the palin. Across the common we now went, walking our natural manner, if we can call staggering kneedeep, thro’ mud & water, natural-

We went thro’ thicket & jungle, thro’ water & <hi>sand</hi>, thro’ mud & long grass, with no success, & re=turned after making an unsuccessful shot at a hare, which however, was so close, as to be called a hair breath escape-(ut we did not laugh at this as we ought to have done, perhaps’)

As we returned & when nearing our en=campment three of four deep favored us, at about seven or eight hundred yards, with a sight of their branching antlers and speed sides, as they stopped snuffed us for a moment, (taking us at a pinch,) and then bounded away, with the con=clusion, we supposed that however seat to us, they were more dear to themselves, and that we should console ourselves after their flight, with the assu=rance contained in the adage “tho lost to sight to memory dear.”

Darkness closing in we returned to our encampment, and found that our comrade had al-ready returned, with no more success than our selves, indeed less, he not having even seen a bird or game of any sort

Cold water, now cause into great request and all were speedily engaged in each anging our heads; never, do we remember feeling so refreshed, as when we had washed away the dust, & in dry garments, with a pipe in our mouth sat down before the blazing fire, and, as the dinner was being prepared — fell into a dreamy reverie, the sensation was novel, and such as approaches, our dinner smokes before us, with tempting a dour, and we fall to with the best of appetites

I be estimated in our next Number.

Epitome.

No news of any consequence has been received this week from the wreck: all are going on well, and the boxes of treasure being burst the divers are how bringing up the rupees loose in bags.

We believe the Commadore intends paying a visit to the wreck in his large some day next week

The launch of H.M.S “Chesapeake” Lueint<hi>&</hi> C.J. Brownrigg in Command left the ship on Tuesday morning early, to visit the wreck, & bring from thence whatever treasure may have been recovered. We have not received any account from this office if his pro-feedings. (we expected it) and are there fore unable to give our readers an accurate idea of the state of our wreck party.	The launch not re=turning on board when expected, the gig was sent to look after her, this latter boat, even, visited the wreck & learnt that the launch had departed long since, so she returned to the ship without any satisfactory intelligence, she was sent a second time with a fresh crew, and no better success attended her efforts.	On Friday morning, tho launch was sighted from the signal staff, & a cutter sent to her with provisions, for which they were hearing glad being almost starved.

Conundrums &c.

35. Why is a bad rider like a man fishing for oysters in this island?.

36 In what respect does Hindoostan resemble a deed of law?

Rebus

An instrument whose potent spell
May raise your water from the well
The claim of all your hungry cousins.
When they flock into you by dozens
These two combined, I think you’ll find
A Vegetable to your mind
Unless your taste is too refined.

Unanswered from last Week.

34. When does a snake most resembler a native of North Britain-?	When he’s well sectoked & nearly got kilt.
