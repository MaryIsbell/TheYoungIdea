                            a close, we may consider that we have arrived at our destination, that
                            our future prospects centre in <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata"

                    </p>
                    <p>What these prospects may be, we are unable to determine at present, although,
                        we may almost dispel the idea of seeing service before the enemy, as we had
                        hoped, our proceedings will most likely consist in various kinds of extra
                        duties, as unpleasant as they are unremunerative.</p>
                    <p>But, at this, we must not repine, for, as <persName

                        expressed in his speech last Sunday, we do as much good, in assisting the
                        arrival, or departure of vessels, in provisioning, storing, repairing,
                        conveying troops or other equally tame work, as though we were in the field;
                        no doubt, some may be inclined to say, that this<cb n="2"/> is merely a
                        propitiatory view of the case, but, we say, it is the fact, and although our
                        inclination leads us to think otherwise and to feel dissatisfied with the
                        failure of our dearest hopes, yet, this should not lessen our zeal in the
                        exercise of our various duties, and hope must brighten our path with the
                        expectation, of not always having such unsatisfactory employment.</p>
                    <p>We cannot disguise the fact that we are "too late for the fair," but yet an
                        old adage says "better late than never" and who knows, or who can foretell,
                        what fortunate circumstances may occur, to reward us for our present
                        disappointment.</p>
                    <p>Of the present state of the rebellion we cannot venture to say much; on

                        English men and women, can wholly forget the perils of their country
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Our information of what is proceeding is therefore very limited, but we hope
                        that next week we may be able to procure intelligence of the successful
                        career of that gallant soldier <persName ref="personography.xml#Campbell"

                    <p>Here we are at last! the external appearance is novel and not uninteresting,
                        what is the interior? Such were our reflections when we had time to look
                        around us, and witness the busy scene,- boats of various shapes and build,
                        dropping with the tide, with their swarthy crews, and the steersman wrapped
                        in a linen robe, wielding the huge oar with which he guides the boat;
                        magnificent merchant ships laying close in shore for repairs, discharging
                        cargo, or other purposes, the forest of masts which met the gaze when it
                        extended up the river, the hum of distant voices, the strange figures,
                        carriages &amp; vehicles of various descriptions passing along the
                        Esplanade, all united to excite us with their novelty, and we were forced to
                        satisfy our curiosity by visiting the shore.</p>
                    <p>On landing we were assailed by numbers of importunate palanquin<cb n="2"/>
                        bearers, who would hardly listen to the negatives we returned to their
                        vociferations of "Palankie Sail" However we managed to escape in safety, and
                        were pursuing our course towards the town when young lad came forward with
                        an umbrella, and notwithstanding our decisive refusals of his services, he
                        persisted in following and shading us from the sun.</p>
                    <p>We found him useful, and intelligent, and had no cause to regret making his
                        acquaintance; he guided us to the bazaars, which reminded us forcibly of the
                        like places for vending goods and merchandize in <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Istanbul">Constantinople</placeName>. The small
                        low shops and dirty lanes, for we cannot designate them streets, the various
                        costumes of the natives, yellow, blue, red and white, the most part clothed
                        in little save their tawny skins, all meeting the eye in a variegated mass,
                        as the whole extent of the bazaar was comprehended at a glance, the creaking
                        of the drays, or waggons, drawn by two small buffaloes, and made of bamboos,
                        with most primitive wheels and harness, the shouts of the palanquin bearers,
                        as they staggered under the weight of some corpulent old gentleman, who
                        perhaps, entertained the opinion that the sun might melt him, were he to
                        expose himself; the touting of the vendors, who, with salaams, begged us to
                        walk into, each, his particular shop, and become their customers, all this
                        and many other circumstances which struck us at the time, brought back very
                        strongly to our memories the streets and bazaars of <placeName

                    <p>After purchasing what we required, and we found that the prices first
                        demanded were high but easily beaten down, we determined to visit now the
                        Esplanade, and see what was going on there. We dismissed our guide with a
                        fee with which he appeared very well pleased, &amp; having refreshed
                        ourselves with an ice at Browne's Hotel, we left our purchases there and
                        strolled forth upon the Esplanade.</p>
                    <p>Here we found Rotten Row, in miniature, whilst upon the green the lovers of
                        exercise amused themselves with cricket, and quoits. The roads were thronged
                        with vehicles &amp; carriages of every description native and European,
                        filled with ladies &amp; gentlemen, enjoying the fresh air; after the sun
                        had expended his power.</p>
                    <p>The complexions of the ladies did not appear to us to have suffered from the
                        heat of the climate, but we suppose they take care not to expose themselves
                        during the day, and thus escape, we could not for one instant entertain an
                        idea of artificial means being resorted to.</p>
                    <p>They certainly appeared to pay as much attention to fashion as in England,
                        but we could not wonder at that, when we saw the immense millinery, and
                        bonnet establishments which with open doors and temptingly displayed head
                        dresses, robes, mantles, &amp;c, &amp;c invited the victims to enter and
                        become an easy prey.</p>
                    <p>The shades of night falling fast and thick, and not wishing to remain any
                        longer on shore, we returned on board, not as well satisfied with <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName>, at first sight, as
                        we had hoped to be.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday evening last (Jan 16) although no land was in sight, we found
                        ourselves nearing the channels of the <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Hugli_River">Hooghly</placeName>. At 6 P.M. we
                        obtained soundings with the deep sea lead and two hours afterwards judging
                        ourselves to be sufficiently near the Pilot station, we anchored for the
                        night in 17 fathoms water, our anchor was again weighed at daylight &amp;
                        about 9 A.M. we passed the first large Buoy that marks the approach to the
                        Eastern channel. At noon we were nearing the Pilot Brig, and the Pilot
                        shortly afterwards came on board. We now ran in till 3 P.M. when the strong
                        tide turning against us, we were again anchored for the night in 7 fathoms
                        water. At Evening Quarters we moved several of the after guns forward to
                        bring the vessel to an even keel: still no land in sight, though the red
                        haze in the Evening horizon seemed to tell of its vicinity.</p>
                    <p>Daylight again found us under way and about 10 A.M. we descried the low banks
                        of the <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Hugli_River">Hooghly</placeName>,
                        opening on either side of us. With the strong tide in our favor, and our
                        engines working at full power, we now advanced very rapidly; the river banks
                        drew nearer to us; <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Sāgar_Island"
                            >Saugar</placeName> appeared on our right <placeName

                        little cluster of shipping at the anchorage. The water which on the previous
                        day had been of a greenish hue, now became very thick and muddy. Objects on
                        shore now became more distinct as the river lessened in width, the banks
                        were still low &amp; level, not an outline of any distant hills to be seen,
                        here &amp; there a rice plantation varied the jungle Native villages,
                        generally clustered about some creek, where a smaller stream <pb n="TYI1074"

                        and then called our attention. In the stream, we passed many vessels, less
                        favoured than ourselves, taking advantage of the tide to move up the river;
                        others in their downward course, lying at anchor till the tide should turn.
                            <ref target="variants.youngidea.xml#BETYI7.01">Now we observed traces of

                        the whole Delta of the Ganges is composed. As we moved swiftly up, the banks
                        of the river glided past like a moving panorama, and the eye could never
                        tire of watching the beautiful scene.</p>

                        was reflected streakily in the ebbing tide, soon darkness came, the river's
                        banks were left to the howling jackal, or the crickets and toads, that made
                        a ceaseless whirring through the watches of the night.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>It is seldom that any great &amp; unprecedented undertaking will meet with
                        the complete success at the first trial: - the great engineering triumphs of
                        the present century have mostly taught us to expect failure before we
                        achieve success: the Thames Tunnel, the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Plymouth
                        Breakwater, because novel &amp; unexampled works, were therefore in the
                        first instance unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore with no surprize that we heard recently either that the
                        Atlantic Telegraph had failed in the first attempt to lay it down, or that
                        the Great Eastern "refuses to move from the spot where it has been built. A
                        second attempt was made to induce this monster of the deep, to take to its
                        aquatic elements; but a second time, it resisted all arguments whether of
                        force or persuasion.</p>
                    <p>A fair lady bestowed its name, and called it<cb n="2"/> "Leviathan" but
                        "Leviathan was as resolute as "Great Eastern" and still remained upon the
                        shore. "Try again" must be the motto of the builders.</p>
                    <p>Again, we read in an other part of our news that "Big Ben,"-the huge Bell
                        that is to swing in the Clock tower of the Palace of Westminster,-"Big Ben"
                        is cracked, his metal was too thin, or his tongue was too thick, and he will
                        now have to be broken up, and his makers must "Try again" before they bring
                        their work to completion.</p>
                    <p>But all these failures, we say, might reasonably be expected; whenever we
                        attempt anything great and noble and unprecedented, neither a first, nor a
                        second, nor a third failure must daunt us. "Try again" must be our motto,
                        and success will eventually crown our perseverance.</p>
                    <p>The "Atlantic Telegraph" shall yet exchange the thoughts of John Bull with

                    <p>As it was understood that most of the <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName> people would be
                        present the occasion presented too much interest for us to neglect
                        witnessing it, and partaking in the ceremony.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly at 1/4 to 10 a.m. we left the ship and engaged a buggy at the
                        landing place, into which four of us were speedily stowed: the driver took
                        us through Fort William and we were thus enabled to take a cursory view of
                        the interior.</p>
                    <p>Here we saw several of the native soldiers on guard without any arm save
                        their ramrods, a significant token of the little trust that can be placed
                        upon these men at the present crisis. </p>
                    <p>After leaving the fort we emerged upon the race course, the grand stand &amp;
                        swimming post suggesting to our minds the exciting scenes, which we had
                        unfortunately missed witnessing, by not reaching this place at an earlier
                        season.</p>
                    <p>It was not long now ere we arrived at the cathedral, although had it not been
                        for a sharp look out kept on our driver, he would most probably have taken
                        us out into the country, as he did not appear to under<cb n="2"/>stand
                        perfectly where we were desirous of being driven to, and was taking a course
                        very different to that we wished. </p>
                    <p>On entering the sacred edifice we found that we were very late, but yet
                        managed to obtain seats, although the position was not good being behind the
                        pulpit.</p>
                    <p>The interior of the building is spacious and airy; the seats are formed of a
                        species of arm chair, thus portioning off to each one a fair space, and even
                        crinoline must share the same as a gentleman of the most slender proportions
                        and consequently no lady could appropriate to herself more room than would
                        be found convenient to a next seat neighbour. We cannot say how the fair sex
                        approve of this arrangement.</p>
                    <p>From the light roof, iron girders dropped, and joined frames of the same
                        material, which ran from one side to the other; we supposed these are
                        intended for the use of punkahs during the hot weather</p>
                    <p>Over the altar a fine large painted window, representing the Crucifixion,
                        attracted our attention. The Pulpit, choir, Altar &amp; reading Desks, were
                        draped in black, and noticing that a large number of the congregation were
                        also arrayed in the sable garments of mourning, we were painfully re<pb

                        the heartrending losses, and bloodshed, which have characterized late
                        times.</p>
                    <p>From our position in the rear of the Preacher (<persName
                            ref="personography.xml#Pratt">Archdeacon Pratt</persName>) we were
                        unfortunately unable to hear his discourse fully, but its main design was to
                        show the great mercy of Almighty God in thus relieving a people who had
                        deemed themselves lost, and had made up their minds to die, as well as to
                        teach us how grateful we should be for all His Mercies, and to put our trust
                        in Him alone.</p>
                    <p>We heard the sounds of subdued sobs from the body of the church, and surely
                        it was sufficient to drain tears of joy and gratitude from those who were so
                        fresh from the scene of danger and distress.</p>
                    <p>We left the cathedral deeply impressed, with the solemnity, and applicability
                        of the service we had witnessed.</p>

                            <p>While walking the Deck by moonlight, in a contemplative mood, on
                                Thursday Evening, two animals of the order "Rodentia," usually
                                called "rats" were observed by the Quartermaster near the main mast.
                                Being much troubled by the apparition, and having an intense
                                aversion to anything in the shape of a rat, (except the rat-tat of
                                the postman's knock) I hasten to inform you of the approach of these
                                formidable foes. I sincerely hope, that our smart, though juvenile
                                members of the feline tribe may now be duly trained and disciplined
                                to meet the foe, and I doubt not that a whole host of asiatic rats
                                will soon be made to fly before the sharp claws of a few brave
                                British cats.</p>

                        which have expanded our hearts with more real enjoyment, than we have
                        experienced since we parted from the oft remembered writers, we come back to
                        the cold stern reality of distance, of our separation.</p>
                    <p>But, stop! We have only spoken of pleasure, as derived from the receipt of
                        letters from our homes; there is yet another view of the matter, and, this,
                        brings grief, in lieu of joy; tears, instead of smiles; and sorrow usurps
                        the place of mirth.</p>
                    <p>Note! Some poor comrade receives a letter whose sable edges bespeak the
                        contents; see! with what trembling hand, and bursting heart he retires into
                        some corner, where in secret he can trace with tearful eyes, the lines which
                        convey the sad intelligence of the death of some dear relative, or
                        friend.</p>
                    <p>Tis thus that each mail must produce different emotions amongst a body of
                        men, and while some are filled with joy,<cb n="2"/> others are drooping with
                        pain and trouble.</p>
                    <p>May we know little of this latter.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>As we believe that many of our readers have availed themselves of our
                        recommendation last week to ascend the Monument on the Esplanade, we will
                        venture to call attention in like manner to the beautiful <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName> tigers which may be
                        seen on the payment of one Rupee in Wood Street, Chowringhee.</p>
                    <p>They have been lately brought from <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow"
                            >Lucknow</placeName>, where they formed a portion of the Royal Menagerie
                        which the Kings of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Ayodhya"
                            >Oude</placeName> have been in the habit of maintaining. </p>
                    <p>The first Tiger you see on entering is a beautiful creature most remarkable
                        for its tameness. At <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow"
                            >Lucknow</placeName> it had been brought up by hand, and led about with
                        only a chain round its neck. It would allow little children to play with it
                        in passing along the streets, and the people of <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName> lamented when they
                        saw it put into a cage, to be carried away.</p>
                    <p>There are 6 or 7 others, of which we recollect two particularly, one because
                        of its ferocious growl, the only savage one, and the other as being the
                        largest of all, and distinguished for the beauty of its stripes, which, it
                        will be observed, are all double.</p>
                    <p>There is a leopard, which is rather too apt to put its paws through the cage,
                        and a chetah <pb n="TYI1093" facs="TYI1093"/><fw>The Young Idea Saturday

                        hunting leopard, which is only confined by a chain, and seems perfectly
                        tame, licking its keeper's hand, and making a gruff, purring, sound, like a
                        cat with a sore throat.</p>
                    <p>There is also a fine Giraffe, perfectly tame, and we recommend visitors to
                        beg the Sikh attendant to take a ride on its back. The man, though full
                        sized, seems quite a pigmy when mounted on the tall quadruped; and we defy
                        any one to keep himself from laughing, when the poor beast sets off at a
                        canter.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p>Our papers, and our Reviews, our periodicals, have all one absorbing topic,
                        and that is India. Fresh details of the horrible sufferings which our
                        countrymen &amp; women underwent in the earlier part of the insurrection,
                        further particulars of the movements of our gallant army, praises of those
                        heroic spirits who have fought and perchance have fallen, before the gates
                        of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Delhi">Delhi</placeName>, or within the
                        walls of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow">Lucknow</placeName>,
                        comments on the past misgovernment of the country, suggestions towards its
                        better management for the future; these seem to form the staple of what we
                        have received by our two last mails; pictorial papers take up the same
                        subject, and views from india, and illustrations of Hindoo customs, now meet
                        us in every page: when we open our Magazines, we find historical papers,
                        tracing the rise of the British dominion in India, dissertations on the
                        variety of races, or essays on the religious, and various forms of feeling
                        which are to be found in this remarkable Asiatic Peninsula.</p>
                    <p>"We spared our readers," says the Times, "as much as we could the pain of
                        revolting and horrible "images; we have no objection<cb n="2"/> that they
                        should know, that there are the most terrible details in the background of
                        outrages perpetrated upon English men and English women." </p>
                    <p>"Christianity," writes the same paper in another article, "is not a religion
                        to be propagated by violence, but it is essentially a religion to be
                        diffused by preaching and teaching. Christians may not make converts by the
                        sword, but they are bound, where they can, to make proselytes by instruction
                        *** our administration in India, has presented the spectacle of one of the
                        greatest Christian powers in the world sedulously bent upon ignoring its own
                        belief.**** In future the religion of the dominant race must be plainly
                        professed, instead of being timidly kept in the background, and the field be
                        opened to missionary exertions with the sanction, instead of the disfavour,
                        of the Government."</p>
                    <p>These sentiments, no doubt, express the feelings of the great majority of our
                        friends in England, and we prefer giving them in the powerful words of the
                        "Times," to endeavouring to clothe them in our own poor language.</p>
                    <p>It may be sufficient for us to rejoice that at such a time, we should have
                        been sent in our floating home, to the very spot on which the eyes of the
                        world, are turned; to see for ourselves something of those scenes which
                        papers so fully describe to our friends at home, and perchance to take part
                        in those transactions, which are yet destined to become matters of
                        history.</p>

                            been productive of more excitement, and enjoyment, than any we remember
                            to have witnessed since our departure from England.</ref>
                    </p>
                    <p>One great event at least, has been its chief characteristic, one day at
                        least, called forth more interest than the others, we speak of the Regatta
                        day, and the attendant entertainment onboard the "<mi:shipName
                            ref="shipography.xml#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</mi:shipName>."</p>
                    <p>Although on this important occasion, our men did not acquit themselves in the
                        manner we had hoped, yet it is a source of deep gratification, to know that
                        the reigning prize of the day, the acme of ambition, the "Prize Cup" was won
                        by our men.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere we shall find a detailed account of the circumstances which marked
                        the day, which we must say could not have been finer or more agreeable, nor
                        can we drop this subject without paying our tribute of admiration to the
                        "fair sex," the bright colours<cb n="2"/> of whose tasteful array, enlivened
                        our decks, and gave the ship a holiday appearance,</p>
                    <p>Our news this week is somewhat general and extensive; we have news of the
                        movements of the Naval Brigade and the probability of intelligence arriving
                        soon of an attack upon <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Lucknow"
                            >Lucknow</placeName>: from <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Yangon"
                            >Rangoon</placeName>, accounts would lead us to believe that the
                        disturbances there are not likely to be settled either quickly or quietly,
                        as, by the <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName>
                        "Englishman" it is reported that Captain Beauchamp <persName
                            ref="personography.xml#Beauchamp_Seymour">Seymour</persName> has landed
                        the crew of the "<mi:shipName ref="shipography.xml#Pelorus"
                            >Pelorus</mi:shipName>" with a view of forming a Naval Brigade, but we
                        must not place implicit reliance upon this latter report, as it is as yet
                        unauthenticated.</p>
                    <p>We can only hope that we shall not be excluded from a participation of
                        whatever may take place in that quarter.</p>

                            <p>An exploring party was recently sent from <placeName
                                    ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> to visit the
                                    <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Andaman_Islands">Andaman
                                    Islands</placeName> in the Bay of Bengal with the view of
                                selecting a site to establish a penal colony, and to banish thither
                                the captive King of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Delhi"
                                    >Delhi</placeName> and his rebel Sepoys. It is remarkable that
                                this group of Islands, tho' so near to the Asiatic Continent, are
                                inhabited by a race of savages, no way akin to the Asiatic tribes,
                                but apparently much nearer allied to the African Negroes. They live
                                in a perfect state of nature, without the slightest vestige of a
                                garment; their huts are mere dens or kennels under which they crawl
                                at night; in fact they seem to be among the most degraded forms of
                                humanity.</p>
                            <p>The first salutation our explorers received was a flight of arrows,
                                but a few musket shots soon dispersed the natives. Two of them were
                                killed, and one captured. This savage has been brought to <placeName
                                    ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> by Dr. .....
                                and both he and Mrs...... have done their best to humanize him by
                                kind treatment. He was introduced to several Negroes of different
                                tribes, but none of them could understand his language.</p>
                            <p>He shews himself not insensible to kindness, and was pleased with Dr.

                                &amp; following the custom of his country on such occasions, he took

                                and with the deepest respect, spat into it.</p>

                        Bluejackets, is scarcely to be imagined. "They are not English "men" say the
                        sepoys. "Nor men, at all, but sea-devils who have come up out of the sea to
                        fight for the Englishmen They do not walk like men, but in a rolling way
                        that shows they have claws upon their feet. They are dressed in a way quite
                        different from Englishmen, they are not tall, but very broad, in fact they
                        are about 5 feet high, by 4 feet broad; they can carry big guns on their
                        shoulders, or under their<cb n="2"/> arms; six of them can bring a gun up a
                        hill, which it would take 200 or 300 sepoys to move at all; they never speak
                        a word, and when they attack they can never be driven back; they are
                        cannibals, and eat sepoys when they have salted them down, sepoy bullets
                        cannot kill them."</p>

                        three days we heard the firing of artillery coming closer and closer; On the

                        by; onwards came the British Troops, driving the cowards in terror before
                        them. Elephants, camels, carts, horses, bullocks, and men made in masses for

                        to break into our gallery. we were suddenly confronted by a strong blow of
                        the Miner's hoe, which brought down the slip of earth dividing us. The man
                        spread out his arms &amp; screamed as I put the muzzle of my pistol to his
                        breast, and shot him. There was a great noise at the top of the shaft; and
                        they called to each other to go, and bring out the dying miner, and his
                        tools. A Sepoy leapt swearing to the bottom; I shot him in the stomach, in
                        the act of firing at me: the commotion now became louder, and the rebels
                        blustered &amp; swore, as if they were all coming down. I taunted them with
                        cowardice, and they, thinking I was a sikh, upbraided me with associating
                        with "<gap reason="indecipherable" atLeast="7" atMost="8" unit="chars"/>"
                        who eat cow's meat and other abominations.</p>
                    <p>I told them I was an European Officer, when they ceased their noise, and
                        listened civilly to me. I asked why had they mutinied? They replied, they
                        were fighting for their religion. "How have we threatened your religion? By
                        giving us greased cartridges. *********</p>
                    <p>They were now desired by the Havildar, or Native Officer to fire at me, but
                        they refused, saying they wanted to hear the Sahib speak." I challenged the
                        Havildar to come down himself, and then said I would bring him some woman's
                        apparel, this retort caused him to swear, and the others to laugh at him.
                        They now commenced filling up the shaft, and I retired to my own gallery. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="underlined">"Escaping in disguise"</hi>. On the 9th November I
                        sought out the spy Kunrigee Lall who - was going back with despatches to
                            <persName ref="personography.xml#Campbell">Sir Colin Campbell</persName>
                        and imparted to him my desire to venture in disguise in his company My
                        attire was soon completed; I was dressed as a Budmash, or Irregular soldier
                        of the city, with sword and shield, native made shoes, tight trousers, a
                        yellow silk koortah over a close fitting white muslin shirt, a yellow
                        coloured chintz sheet thrown round my shoulders, a cream coloured turban,
                        and a white waistband or "Kummerbund", My face and neck down to the
                        shoulders, and my hands to the wrists, were coloured with lampblack, the
                        cork used being dipped in oil to cause the colour to adhere. After being
                        provided with a small double barrelled pistol, and a pair of broad pyjamahs
                        over the tight trousers, I proceeded with Kunrigee Lall to the banks of the
                            <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Gomati_River">river
                        Goomtee</placeName>. We undressed and quickly forded the river, which was
                        about 4 1/2 ft. deep, and about 100 yards wide at this point. My courage
                        failed me while in the water, and if my guide had been within reach, I
                        should perhaps have pulled him back and abandoned the<cb n="2"/> enterprize
                        **** With my <gap reason="indecipherable"/> resting on my shoulder, we
                        advanced among the huts in front, where I accosted a matchlock man, "The
                        night is cold"; he answered to my remark "It is very cold"*** We passed
                        unnoticed thro' a number of Sepoys and matchlock men, some of whom, were
                        escorting persons of rank in palanquins, preceded by torches. I jostled
                        against several armed men in the street, but was not spoken to. **** I was
                        in great spirits when we reached the green fields, into which I had not been
                        for five months Everything around us smelt sweet, and a carrot I took from
                        the roadside, was, the most delicious I ever tasted. I gave vent to my
                        feelings in a conversation with Kenrigee Lall, who joined in my admiration
                        of the province of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Ayodhya"
                            >Oudh</placeName>, and lamented that it was now in the hands of
                        wretches, whose misgovernment and rapacity was ruining it.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="underlined">"Arrival at the British Camp"</hi>. By 3 o'clock in the
                        morning we arrived at a grove of mango trees, in which a man was singing at
                        the top of his voice! He was alarmed at hearing us approach, and astonished
                        us also, by calling out a guard of 25 Sepoys, all of whom asked questions.
                        Kunrigee Lall lost heart for the first time, and threw away the letter
                        entrusted to him for <persName ref="personography.xml#Campbell">Sir Colin
                            Campbell</persName> I kept mine safe in my turban. We satisfied the

                    <p>It was near 4 o'clock in the morning when we heard the English challenge "Who
                        comes there?" We had reached a British cavalry outpost. My eyes filled with
                        joyful tears, and I thanked God for having safely conducted one through this
                        dangerous enterprize. </p>

                    <p>The city of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Delhi">Delhi</placeName>
                        originally bore the name of Indraprasthe, and was the royal capital of the
                        aboriginal Pandoos. After falling into decay and lying desolate for a period
                        of eight centuries, it was revived again (about A.D. 792) by a descendant of
                        the ancient Kings, entitled Bulwan Deo.</p>
                    <p>It was he who changed the name from Indraprasthe to <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Delhi">Delhi</placeName>, the origin of which is
                        related as follows:-</p>
                    <p>"There was in one part of the city an iron "kheel" or pillar, said to have
                        been left standing by the ancient "Pandoos" Tradition attached a sacred
                        import to this pillar, and alleged it to be based upon a pedestal fixed in
                        the regions of hell. As Bulwan Deo doubted the truth of the legend, the
                        sceptic monarch determined to test the depth, and he caused the pillar to be
                        violently shaken. A stream of blood immediately gushed up from the earth's
                        centre, and the pillar from that time became loose or in their own language
                        "dheli"</p>
                    <p>This was the original of the name of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Delhi"

                        Having received a good account of the game with the scoring made on this
                        occasion, and this being the first time our club has done battle with other

                        batting of <persName ref="personography.xml#Taylor">Taylor</persName>, who
                        made some capital hits till a "ripper" from <persName
                            ref="personography.xml#Brownrigg">Mr Brownrigg</persName> levelled his
                        stirrups to the tune of 24 runs. Of the remainder only three managed to make
                        scores, and amongst them, we may mention a good stroke for 5 of <persName
                            ref="personography.xml#Reynolds">Reynolds</persName>. Owing to the
                        excellent fielding of <persName ref="personography.xml#Shortt">Mr.
                            Shortt</persName> as Longstop, they only managed to score 2 Byes.</p>
                    <p>The officers now went in, but did not make as much play as was expected:
                            <persName ref="personography.xml#A_D_McArthur">Mr. McArthur's</persName>
                        wicket being laid low by a "daisy clipper" from Bew at the very first ball.
                        This, and the retiring of our <persName ref="personography.xml#Brownrigg"
                            >Brownrigg</persName> (to whom all looked for a large score) soon after,
                        by one of the same puzzlers, damped the spirits of the Gentlemen, but the
                        good play of <persName ref="personography.xml#Theobald">Mr.
                            Theobald</persName>, who kept the field alive till he was caught out by

                            <persName ref="personography.xml#Shortt">Mr Shortt</persName>, who was
                        finally run out, gave them renewed ardour.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the first innings which was a close struggle, both
                        parties scored the same, and bets were now freely offered of 3 to 1 upon the
                        Gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>The P.O's now went in again, and now <persName
                            ref="personography.xml#Brownrigg">Mr. Brownrigg</persName> shone forth
                        in his true light as a first rate Bowler: their best man soon had his wicket
                        rattled down, and in one over three batsmen took their places and as quickly
                        retired to his well delivered balls which kept the umpire continually
                        employed in repitching the wickets. The result was the P.O's second innings
                        only amounted to 41 runs, making a total of 90.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="personography.xml#Brownrigg">Mr Brownrigg</persName> and
                            <persName ref="personography.xml#Shortt">Mr Shortt</persName> now took
                        their places, and the play became remarkably good and lively, until
                            <persName ref="personography.xml#Shortt">Mr Shortt</persName>
                        unfortunately delivered a ball back to the bowler, and was thus caught
                        out.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="personography.xml#Wilkinson">Mr Wilkinson</persName> relieved
                        him, and "fast and furious" was the game. Mr Brownrigg serving out 4s &amp;
                        5s, &amp; 3s to all parts of the field, <persName

                        with steady play, and some first rate forward drives. These two remained in
                        for upwards of an hour together, till at last a "disturber" from <persName
                            ref="personography.xml#Bew">Bew</persName> rattled the bails off
                            <persName ref="personography.xml#Wilkinson">Mr Wilkinson's</persName>
                        stumps, and came out with his flushing honours thick upon him.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="personography.xml#A_D_McArthur">Mr McArthur</persName> took
                        his bat, but after adding 15 to the score, amongst which were two good hits
                        for 5 and 4, was run out: <persName ref="personography.xml#Theobald">Mr

                        several centuries It is the largest gull known, as well as the most
                        destructive, and truculent. In fact those who have effected its capture
                        deserve the gratitude of the world, as Hercules did for destroying the great
                        Hydra. It is supposed that the species will soon be extinct. Its plumage is
                        said to have been very gorgeous, but is now considerably tarnished </p>
                    <p>Several young gulls were caught in the same nest, but from their ferocity,
                        were immediately destroyed. <pb n="TYI1114" facs="TYI1114"/><fw>The Young

                        has actually been delivered of a pun. Hear it! Oh ye punsters of the earth,
                        and say what shall be done to our poor shore going contemporary. Describing
                        the Military Review on the Espalanade (Novr 24) "They halted" says the
                        Englishman "near the Peepul tree, and People's tree it ought to be called
                        for it was crowded with human denizens." And this vile pun has actually gone
                        home to England. What shall we do to the man who punned it? Shall we enroll
                        him at once among the Pundits of Hindoostan? or shall we condemn him to
                        stand forever fanning us with the Punkah? or shall we consign him to eternal
                        punishment, in the far distant regions of the Punjaab? Altho many would say
                        "Gently with this pun," we cannot help writing pungently, and making a stir
                        about a pun from such a punster.<cb n="2"/></p>

                    </head>
                    <p>On Monday night the 22d Inst. of the Rajah Budderaunth Roy Behadoor
                        celebrated the marriage of his Granddaughter, with a grand dinner party
                        fireworks and a nautch. For the information of those of our readers who were
                        unfortunately unable to go, we will attempt a slight description of the
                        events of the evening, altho' we feel that our pen will fail to convey to
                        the <choice>

                        it "in propria persona."</p>
                    <p>We left the ship rather late (about 7 PM the dinner being announced for 7:30)
                        and on landing at Baboo's Ghant found to our dismay that no garrie was
                        waiting for us, this caused some little consternation, but a consultation
                        being held, we acted speedily upon its determination, &amp; were quickly
                        ensconced in palanqains on arriving at Wilson's Hotel, we managed to obtain
                        a garrie &amp; without further delay than we could help, set off for
                        Cossipore. Our <gap reason="indecipherable"/> proved to be one of the best
                        of his kind, keeping his cattle well up to the mark.</p>
                    <p>We passed through the dirty, dismal, native quarter, faintly lit by the
                        flickering glare of oil lamps, with dusky, half clad forms flitting about in
                        the misty, smoky atmosphere, which made our eyes smart and fill with tears.
                        Here and there in the deep, gloomy, shade of the interior of an old and
                        shaky building, could be seen a dark object bending over the earthenware
                        pan, in which the evening meal was cooking, whilst the flare of the lambent
                        flame as it shot up from under, would for an instant light up his dim
                        countenance &amp; the surrounding objects, and then as instantly subsiding
                        would render the obscurity more intense than ever.</p>
                    <p>As we speeded along and left the suburbs of the city, emerging into more open
                        country, the notes of warning our driver had been repeatedly uttering,
                        gradually ceased, and we found ourselves passing extensive gardens, with an
                            occa<pb n="TYI1122" facs="TYI1122"/><fw>The Young Idea" Saturday 27<hi

                        here, &amp; there. At last we arrived at a place where four roads met, &amp;
                        most likely would have proceeded straight on, had not a figure which stood
                        in the road acquainted our driver that his proper course was the turning to
                        the right.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after a blaze of light on our left hand told us that we were
                        approaching our goal, a few minutes more and we entered the Rajah's garden.
                        We were quite surprized at the number of lamps, and the brilliancy of the
                        illuminations, it was a transition from night to day: altho we consider that
                        the effect would have been more perfect had the lamps been variegated. On
                        our left was a large tank, surrounded by railings, on which lamps were hung,
                        close together, we are perfectly unable to judge of the probable number in
                        this spot alone, for the tank was one of the largest we have seen, &amp; the
                        lights almost touched on another: the reflection in the still water, greatly
                        enhanced the effect, especially that caused by a large building on the
                        opposite side, which was in one perfect blaze, &amp; of which we shall speak
                        more fully anon.</p>
                    <p>The strains of a band met our ears as we rattled down to the garden house,
                        where upon emerging from our trap, we found the dinner was proceeding. We
                        entered and soon procured seats, which were apparently the only empty ones,
                        for we noticed some after arrivals who were unable to obtain even a corner
                        of the table. The dinner was in every respect perfect. having been placed
                        under the sole arrangement of Messrs Wilson &amp; <choice>
                            <expan>Company</expan>
                            <abbr>Co</abbr>
                        </choice> of Auckland Hotel, we regretted much not having arrived in time to
                        witness the appearance of the table previous to the attack, but as it was
                        (fish having been just removed) it looked remarkably well and the taste
                        displayed in the several minutiae which characterize a well laid table,
                        spoke well for the capacity of the hands to whose care the management was
                        entrusted. The room itself was gaily decorated with banners &amp; flags of
                        England, France and Turkey, and was well lighted by chandeliers, and
                        Moderator lamps. The many uniforms, of which red decidedly preponderated,
                        &amp; the glittering of the naval epaulettes, varied with the sober black of
                        the civilians, greatly enhanced the brilliancy of the table.</p>
                    <p>Having appeased our appetite and slaked our thirst with first rate champagne
                        &amp; hearing sounds of native music &amp; singing in an adjoining room, we
                        quitted the table and adjourned to the apartment whence the sounds
                        proceeded. On our way thither we stopped to examine several swords &amp;
                        spears, daggers &amp; c of real Damascus steel and beautifully worked, the
                        hilts &amp; crosspieces, inlaid with gold and precious stones of all kinds.
                        We also saw a magnificent diamond in a glass case, said to be worth
                        £180.000. Of furniture we cannot speak as the rooms are all furnished in
                        Eastern style, &amp; consequently there is no display of tables, and chairs,
                        couches, settees, &amp;c, &amp;c, which we see in our commonest drawing
                        rooms in England. One small table &amp; that of marble, supported a tray
                        with betel nut and a jug of water for the benefit of the native guests,
                        &amp; carpets, spread upon a platform in a room through which we passed,
                        were appropriated to their use.</p>
                    <p>On entering the room from which the nautch music had proceeded, we found that
                        we were just too late, as we caught a stern view of the musicians, as they
                        passed out of the door opposite to that we entered by. The interior
                        presented a very gay appearance, for here we saw the various garbs and
                        picturesque dresses of the native visitors, who were seated on a cushioned
                        seat which went all round the room. Some were arrayed most magnificently <cb
                            n="2"/>in shawls woven with gold, velvet embroiderd with gold, in fact
                        all the garments were heavy and thick with gold. The Rajah himself wore
                        round his neck a diamond necklace valued at £200,000 and almost all wore
                        heavy massive gold chains.</p>
                    <p>The sharp whiz of a rocket announced to us that the fireworks were
                        commencing. We immediately allied forth and found ourselves in front of the
                        tank, which was reflecting on its placid surface the last falling stars of
                        the first rocket: carriages, &amp; horses, were near and around us, and as a
                        blaze of light suddenly illuminated the whole scene before us, the poor
                        frightened animals snorted &amp; started with terror, &amp; required the
                        utmost efforts of the drivers to keep them from fairly bolting away. Our
                        first care was to get out of the way of anything like a horse, and then we
                        turned to view the magnificent spectacle before us. In front &amp; around us
                        on every side, bright masses of flame, shot up in the air, dense masses of
                        smoke curled heavily upwards, thro' which flights of rockets shot with their
                        hissing roar and blue fireballs formed their graceful curves.</p>
                    <p>On our right a large piece of firework was set fire to, from its original
                        appearance we supposed that it was intended to pourtray the burning of a
                        house, but as it quickly went into an entire flame, it only represented a
                        burst of flame lighting up the visages of those around us with a pale
                        unearthly glare, and by the strong but fitful illumination which it cast on
                        the projecting points of the building, throwing the recesses into gloomier
                        shadow. In various parts of the gardens, fresh gleams of light shot up &amp;
                        rockets filled the air with their fiery balls, threatening to cause some
                        damage by their falling sticks, which very often descended amongst the
                        crowd.</p>
                    <p>The brilliant scene was rendered doubly impressive by the reflecting of water
                        &amp; the dense volume of smoke which hung like a canopy over the whole
                        gardens. The display which formed the finale, was erected on the opposite
                        bank of the tank, to that on which we stood and when first lighted
                        represented a square body of white fire and an arch. As the fire decreased,
                        a blue flickering flame made its appearance, and gradually increased in
                        strength until at last in the square, we read the sentence, "God save the
                        Queen, and the Young couple every Happiness," and the arch shone forth as an
                        arbour over which the blue flame played in a wavy, flickering light. This
                        was immediately hailed with three hearty cheers from the Officers &amp;
                        Englishmen present, and the company then strolled about enjoying in many
                        cases the luxury of <gap reason="indecipherable"/>. We followed the example
                        and then returned to the building to witness the nautch, which was about to
                        recommence.</p>
                    <p>After a short time the performers entered. They consisted of a girl, dressed
                        in a dark brown gauze dress, and scarf trimmed &amp; embroidered profusely
                        with gold, and particoloured trousers, made very full so as to hide the
                        feet. Her headdress consisted of a frontlet, hanging over the forehead with
                        side pieces and a backpiece, all of gold or imitation and studded with
                        various coloured stones. Her hands were adorned with rings &amp; from one on
                        each finger a chain communicated with a circular <pb n="TYI1123"
                            facs="TYI1123"/><fw>The Young Idea" Saturday 27<hi rend="superscript"

                        the bracelets, the back of the hand being thus covered with gold. Her
                        personal appearance was not in the least attractive in fact she looked most
                        remarkably like a monkey dressed up Four musicians accompanied her in her
                        song, which was perfectly unintelligible, altho' good taste was exhibited in
                        the instrumental sound being commanded by the vocal of the musicians two
                        played upon a species of violin supported in a linen band which went round
                        the waist, the bow being handled in much the same manner as a bass viol
                        player would hold it Another had two little brass cymbals about the size of
                        the palm of the hand, which he manipulated with extreme dexterity, and under
                        his able guidance they emitted a pleasant jingling sound. The fourth played
                        on two small drums of curious shape &amp; make suspended round his waist in
                        a linen cloth, and which were played by the action of the fingers &amp;
                        palms of the hand. The costumes of the men were nothing out of the common
                        native dress excepting the nether garments of the "drummer" as we call him,
                        and we heard them very much admired, not only for their pattern, "a pink
                        check":-but for the cut &amp; fit, which would have gained the envy and
                        admiration of all Regent Street, had they been there displayed.</p>
                    <p>The dancing consisted of an advancing &amp; retrograde movement, accompanied
                        with a waving motion of the hands the arms being held in would-be graceful
                        positions over the head, &amp; the feet being occasionally brought together
                        so as to make the anclets strike &amp; jingle. Altogether nothing absurd and
                        vapid ever met our gaze, novelty was its only charm, and we left the room to
                        visit the marriage presents &amp; the celebration of the marriage
                        ceremony.</p>
                    <p>We bent our steps towards the building we have mentioned as attracting our
                        attention from its blaze of light, when we entered. Here we found all the
                        presents arranged for exhibition, amongst which we noticed cup, and trays of
                        solid silver, two handsome enamelled serpent-bracelets studded with diamonds
                        and amethysts, with large rubies in the heads, a necklace of pearls, with
                        emeralds at equidistances: several handsome cachmere shawls, gold rings,
                        linen pieces silver worked vases, and a bedstead of solid sliver, with rose
                        coloured mosquito curtains and a coverlet of Persian workmanship. Wreaths of
                        white flowers were heaped up in a silver bowl, and on a large plate of the
                        same metal small bouquets of flowers were arranged.</p>
                    <p>Close by under a canopy supported by poles of solid silver, sat the
                        bridegroom robed in a splendid shawl, and surrounded by priests in front of
                        him, sat a nautch girl, with her attendant musicians, keeping up a
                        neverending song in Persian and now, we were informed that the ceremony
                        would commence shortly, so we determined to wait and not miss it. Smoking
                        was not considered offensive, so we whiled away the time, scanning &amp;
                        enquiring into the various novelties surrounding us, which excited our
                        curiosity, and which would require the space of a volume to enumerate. The
                        bridegroom appeared to be about 15 years of age and if we might judge by his
                        countenance did not seem to entertain a high notion of the felicity of his
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>We had not long to wait before a change took place. The Bridegroom rose from
                        his luxurious seat and the priests arrayed him in snow white linen garments;
                        he now took his station upon a square piece of sandalwood, painted and
                        ornamented in a pretty device, and squatted down in Hindoo fashion upon his
                        haunches: a very strange looking white turban was not placed on his head and
                        in front of this was fastened a high frontlet, made of worked silver wire
                        (and presenting in a front <cb n="2"/> view, the appearance of a parish
                        beadle's cocked hat), with two enormous tassels depending from each end.</p>
                    <p>He sat, or rather squatted in this position for about half an hour, when the
                        priests again disrobed him and redressed him in red silk leaving the right
                        shoulder &amp; arm bare, again he squatted down, &amp; the large fronlet was
                        removed, &amp; a smaller but similar headdress took its place &amp; the two
                        bracelets I have mentioned before were clasped on his wrists. He now bared
                        his right knee, and his father who was seated on his right hand between two
                        priests, extended his right hand &amp; placed the two forefingers &amp;
                        thumb on his son's knee; at first we were under the impression that he was
                        testing him by introducing some pointed instrument, but as he remained in
                        this position for about ten minutes, we were unable to determine what the
                        intention was. The presents were then shown to him the shawls, rings &amp;c
                        being passed round so his father who held them before him.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after this ceremony the priests, bridegroom &amp; his father rose,
                        and being once more enveloped in the ample folds of the cachmere shawl, he
                        was led away with torchbearers in front, to visit, (as we were informed) the
                        family, &amp; to be introduced for the first time to the bride. During his
                        absence we were decorated with bouquets &amp; wreaths of a sweet smelling
                        white flower, &amp; presented a very gay appearance with our caps and
                        breasts thus adorned.</p>
                    <p>About 20 min. elapsed when the bridegroom reappeared and took his station as
                        before on the square of sandalwood, a similar one was placed opposite to him
                        the bride appeared and squatted down upon it; a voice in the crowd
                        immediately called for "Three Cheers for the Bride" which were heartily
                        given. Poor little thing!!! She had arrived at the mature age of 9 and was
                        already to become a wife. She was dressed in red silk similar to her
                        husband, and a ring through her nose. Think of this! Oh! ye' fair brides of
                        England, but let me inform you that this is a religious custom, &amp; was
                        not placed there for her future husband to make use of to "lead her by the
                        nose".</p>
                    <p>The fingers of her right hand were now entwined with his, and a wreath of
                        flowers bound round them, the holy water of the Ganges was next poured over
                        the joined hands. A gold ring was then placed in the father's hand, who held
                        it in the vessel containing the holy water, and repeated a long
                        unintelligible rigmarole after the priest, after which it was placed on the
                        two joined hands of the young couple &amp; holy water sprinkled over it,
                        Incense was then burnt, the hands separated and the ceremony completed. </p>
                    <p>The happy (?) pair were led off by torchlight. For ourselves, we made it our
                        study to find our garrie and having succeeded after some little trouble, we
                        were speedily borne from this novel and interesting scene, and returned on
                        board heartily pleased with our excursion. </p>

                    <p>On Thursday afternoon a Cricket Match took place between the "<mi:shipName
                            ref="shipography.xml#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</mi:shipName>" eleven, and
                        the Squadron eleven, which resulted we are sorry to say in the defeat of the
                        former. The wickets were pitched at 2 P.M. on the ground near <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Ochterlony_Monument">the Ochterbury
                            monument</placeName>, the squadron eleven going into the wickets first.
                        The play was remarkably good, but we consider that the high score made by
                        Mr. <persName ref="personography.xml#Hope">Hope</persName> was the cause of
                        the Squadron proving the winners. We must give due credit to them, they
                        played beautifully, and owing to their good fielding, the <mi:shipName
                            ref="shipography.xml#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</mi:shipName>'s were sadly
                        cut up for runs.</p>

                        than they fielded, indeed, it was a strange fact, that those from whom
                        little was expected, played well and steadily, and did much to the
                        augmentation of the score. They were greatly dispirited at the early
                        overthrow of their best man Mr <persName ref="personography.xml#Brownrigg"
                            >Brownrigg</persName>, who striking at a ball which was pitched high
                        over his head, tipped the ball right into the hands of mid-wicket.</p>

                        were very anxious to finish the game (only one innings having been played)
                        by a second innings on the following day, but the squadron, anxious perhaps
                        to retain the victory, appeared unwilling &amp; finally stated that

                        the first time at the <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata"
                            >Calcutta</placeName> Lyric Theatre. The Drama performed was <ref rend="new"

                    <p>We cannot speak too highly of the creditable manner in which the performers
                        acted, although a shore going paper has been pleased to insult them, and to
                        cast a baneful shadow over their efforts to please. <ref rend="new"
                            target="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1060150314000060">We only regret that
                            such a splenetic effusion should have ever been permitted to appear in
                            print; the more especially as we consider that jealousy, that greeneyed
                            monster: was the cause of the unwarrantable attack upon the labours of
                            our men.</ref></p>
                    <p>The purely acrimonious composition and illiberal manner in which the several
                        "dramatis personae" are pulled to pieces could not have proceeded from any
                        other source, than that of<cb n="2"/> envy and vexation at the successful
                        result of the entertainment, which the writer who is doubtless a member of
                        the <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> Amateur
                        Performers, never before witnessed, when himself and fellow players have
                        acted.</p>
                    <p>But we can afford to take no more notice of him.</p>
                    <p>The Drama was ably supported by the various characters, <persName
                            ref="personography.xml#George_Horner"/>Geo Horner as the Miser, Claude
                        Darnaud was perfect, and <persName ref="personography.xml#Henry_Underhill"
                        />Hy Underhill as Simon Siggel, in the hunger which he so well portrayed,
                        produced a sympathetic feeling, which we were under the necessity of
                        allaying directly the theatre closed. We unfortunately cannot spare the
                        space to bring all of the actors to notice, but it will be enough to say
                        that they gave general satisfaction with the exception of our rancorous
                        friend.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion, the laughable burlesque tragic opera Bombastes Furioso, was
                        ably sustained and to <persName ref="personography.xml#Henry_Underhill"
                            >Henry Underhill</persName> as General Bombastes, we must here give the
                        palm for the inimitable manner in which he carried out his part.</p>
                    <p>The band of the <mi:shipName ref="shipography.xml#Chesapeake"
                            >Chesapeake</mi:shipName> attended and contributed largely to the
                        entertainment, a prologue written expressly for the occasion by one of the
                        performers was highly thought of and a hornpipe by Thomas Walsh was
                        enthusiastically encored.</p>
                    <p>We were very glad to see the front circles so well filled, the ladies
                        appearing to enjoy the novel scene, especially, and we may say that the
                        whole passed off most satisfactorily.</p>

                            <p>Much disappointment has been caused by your passing over with so
                                slight a mention, what we have considered one of the principal
                                events in our nautical existence; namely the landing of our
                                Bluejackets, and Marines on the morning of the 19th February, for
                                exercise on the <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata"
                                    >Calcutta</placeName> Esplanade. All performed their part so
                                well, all returned to the ship so pleased at their own performance,
                                that I hope, Mr. Editor you will not consider me too obtrusive if I
                                beg for a little longer notice. Everybody knows that the soul of an
                                Editor is everywhere present and that he sees everything and that
                                nothing can escape his keep observation</p>
                            <p>I will not stop to comment on the glass of medicinal liquid which was
                                served out to us on deck before we started, and which I think they
                                called Quinine Wine, and will only suggest to the Doctor that most
                                of us thought a little drop of Rum (neat) would have comforted our
                                inner man much more to our satisfaction.<pb n="TYI1133"

                            <p>Our boats were quickly manned, and no time was lost in reaching the
                                shore, and scrambling up the river's bank. It was but just daylight
                                when we were drawn up in order, and commenced our march along the
                                river side. Our pioneers led the way armed with crowbars, and
                                shovels, under the guidance of two Engineers, and showed that they
                                would be as serviceable in the trenches as in the stoke hole: then
                                came our lively band, which made us step out like men, next the
                                company of Marines (Artillery and Light Infantry), then the
                                Bluejackets in their several Divisions:-like men, I say for however
                                we may admire the mechanical march of drilled soldiers, I hope
                                Bluejackets will always have the free use of their arms and
                                legs.</p>
                            <p>When we arrived on the field of action, our Artillery Companies
                                separated and marched to Fort William to bring out their Field
                                pieces, while we remained exercising in the field: it would weary
                                your readers, Mr. Editor to describe the whole course of our
                                proceedings, how we prepared to resist cavalry, formed into square
                                &amp;c-&amp;c:- suffice it to say that great satisfaction was caused
                                to ourselves, and great wonderment to the native niggers, and we
                                only wished that a few hundred Sepoys were there to practice upon in
                                real earnest. As for the Marine Light Infantry they went right away
                                all over the <cb n="2"/>field and I did not wonder at their having a
                                jolly good run - skirmishing they called it - after being so long
                                penned up on board ship.</p>
                            <p>The "bang, bang", of our field pieces, now drew the attention of all
                                    <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName>
                                upon us, and the fashionable ladies and gentlemen who were out
                                riding, came flocking round us to see so novel a spectacle. The
                                artillery did as beautifully as all the rest of us, and even the
                                small guns worked by small boys, made a very considerable noise on
                                this eventful occasion. But everything must have an end, Mr Editor,
                                so had our field practice, &amp; so also must my letter. See us
                                again drawn up in the line of march, again the lively strains of the
                                "Cheasapeake's" band float over the <placeName

                                British Tars returning to their "Wooden Walls"</p>
                            <p>It would be unjust not to mention how these wooden walls were guarded
                                in our absence, and how gallantly the Idlers on board prepared to
                                repel boarders in case of invasion:- Those who saw the ship's

                        destroy its effect. We certainly expected that our Amateurs would not come
                        off scatheless, but we were totally unprepared for such an egregious attack
                        as has been made upon them in the Bengal Hurkaru. It was with mingled
                        feelings of astonishment, anger, and amusement we perused the inconsiderate
                        critique upon their endeavours. The whole when carefully weighed forms a
                        "tout ensemble" of the most ridiculous character, and we therefore advise
                        all those who read it to take it in that light, basing their opinions, not
                        merely upon a sentence extracted here and there but upon the general
                        sentiment it contains. It opens with a personal cut at Mr. Van Gelder,
                        thereby evincing that a wish to bring him before the public as a laughing
                        stock, was a prominent feature in the desire to ridicule, which animated the
                        narrow mind, which presumed to judge of our Amateurs performance. The writer
                        then proceeds to state that "he trembled for the fate of those of Neptune's
                        Hardy Sons"—for why? because "the beauty and fashion of <placeName
                            ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata">Calcutta</placeName> were present," most
                        likely he imagined the "hardy sons of Neptune" could never stand a battery
                        of bright eyes, however brave when confronting a battery of heavy guns. But
                        we cannot afford space to pull him to pieces in the manner he deserves, but
                        we must notice one thing. The word "Ditchers." such is the very euphonious
                        appellation which the Histrionic Critic of the Hurkaru claims for himself
                        and his copeers of <placeName ref="placeography.xml#Kolkata"
                            >Calcutta</placeName>. We will not now enquire into the origin of the
                        name, but simply observe that such being the title of our assailant, we need
                        not feel surprised to find him such an adept in the art of "flinging mud."
                        We close this article by publishing the Prologue which was read and written
                        expressly for the occasion.</p>
